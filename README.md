# Loops README

## Overview
This Python script provides examples of using `for` and `while` loops to iterate over elements and perform specific actions. The code includes demonstrations of basic `for` loop usage, iterating over lists, and incorporating `continue` and `break` statements. The primary focus is on understanding the flow control within loops.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the syntax and usage of `for` and `while` loops in Python.
- Learn to iterate over ranges, lists, and manipulate loop flow with `continue` and `break` statements.

## Code Structure

### 1. `for` Loops
   - **`rangeLoop(number)`**
     - Iterates over a range of numbers (0 to `number - 1`) and prints each number.
   
   - **`listForLoop(listGiven)`**
     - Iterates over the elements of a given list and prints each element.

   - **`continueInLoop(listGiven)`**
     - Demonstrates the use of `continue` statement to skip specific elements in the loop.

   - **`breakInLoop(listGiven)`**
     - Demonstrates the use of `break` statement to exit the loop when a specific condition is met.

### 2. `while` Loops
   - **`whileIntLoop(var)`**
     - Prints numbers starting from `var` and increments until reaching 5.

   - **`whileContLoop(num)`**
     - Demonstrates the use of `continue` statement in a `while` loop, skipping a specific value.

## Usage
1. Uncomment the desired function calls within the `main()` function to execute specific examples.
   - Example: Uncomment `# rangeLoop(4)` to run the `rangeLoop` function with the argument 4.

2. Run the script to observe the output for each loop example.

Feel free to modify the code or use these examples as a reference for understanding and practicing loop structures in Python.
